🚀 DSA Practice – LeetCode & GeeksforGeeks

This repository contains my daily Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice, including solutions to problems from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.

I aim to strengthen my problem-solving skills, improve my understanding of core algorithms, and maintain consistency by solving at least one problem every day.

📌 What’s Inside?

🧠 Daily solutions to LeetCode & GFG problems

📝 Clean and readable implementations

📂 Categorized solutions (Arrays, Strings, DP, Trees, Graphs, etc.)

💡 Well-commented code for better understanding

📈 My progress toward becoming better at competitive programming & interviews

🎯 Goals

Maintain a daily coding streak

Strengthen fundamentals in DSA

Improve problem-solving speed and accuracy

Prepare for FAANG and top-tech interviews

🛠 Tech Stack

C++ (primary language)

Occasionally Python / JavaScript depending on the problem

Platforms: LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks

📅 Daily Progress

I solve at least one DSA problem every single day, consistently improving through practice and revision.
